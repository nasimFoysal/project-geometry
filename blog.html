                <h2 class="text-center">What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h2>
                <h4 class="text-decoration-underline">Answer :</h4>
                <p>DOM is the short form for Document Object Model. Whatever we write in HTML is static. We can not
                    interact
                    with HTML alone. To interact with a webpage, we need programming languages, like JavaScript. But
                    JavaScript can't understand HTML. It understands objects and arrays etc. But since a webpage is
                    mainly
                    HTML, JavaScript convert the HTML into an object like model. And this object model has many methods
                    and
                    functions. By using these methods, JavaScript gets access to the HTMl elements. It can then modify,
                    add,
                    delete the elements as needed. This is the purpose of DOM.</p>

                <h4 class="text-center">Question: 2</h4>
                <h2 class="text-center"> How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.</h2>
                <h4 class="text-decoration-underline">Answer :</h4>
                <p>
                    By using DOM, we can select the HTML elements in 5 methods.
                <ol>
                    <li>getElementsByTagName()</li>
                    <li>getElementsByClassName()</li>
                    <li>getElementById()</li>
                    <li>querySelector()</li>
                    <li>querySelectorAll()</li>

                </ol>
                getElementsByTagName() method select all the elements of a given tag. It returns an HTML collection. We
                can
                then modify the HTML by looping through this array like HTML collection. For example,
                element.getElementsByTagName("tag")
                getElementsByClassName() method works the same way as getElementsByTagName(). The difference is it takes
                the
                name of the class as a parameter. For example, element.getElementsByClassName("class-name")

                getElementById() method takes the id of an element.It doesn't return an HTML collection because id is
                unique
                in HTML. For example, element.getElementById("id")

                Since querySelector() and querySelectorAll() methods are CSS selectors, while giving parameters, css
                class
                selector "." and id selector "#" should be given accodringly.

                <h2 class="text-center"> What is event bubble?</h2>
                <h4 class="text-decoration-underline">Answer :</h4>
                <p>
                    Event bubbling is a method of event propagation in the HTML DOM. Let's say there is an event an
                    element
                    inside another element, and both elements have registered a handle to that event. It is a process
                    that
                    starts with the element that triggered the event and then bubbles up to the containing elements in
                    the
                    hierarchy. In event bubbling, the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element and
                    then
                    propagated to outer elements.

                <h2 class="text-center">What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h2>
                <h4 class="text-decoration-underline">Answer :</h4>
                <p>The function that is passed as an argument inside another function is called a callback function.</p>
                <p>We need callback functions because many JavaScript actions are asynchronous, which means they don't
                    really stop the program (or a function) from running until they're completed, as you're probably
                    used
                    to. Instead, it will execute in the background while the rest of the code runs.</p>
